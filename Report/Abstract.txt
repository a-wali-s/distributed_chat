Abstract
In this paper, we discuss the creation of a fully peer-to-peer distributed message-passing framework. To help implement and test this framework, we have also created a chat system that uses this framework. In order to minimize messages sent, we arrange all peers into a spanning tree, and route messages through all peers. This allows us to achieve O(n) messages sent to get a message to every peer, rather than O(n^2) as in a complete graph. Since the main weakness with a spanning tree architecture is that vertex removal splits the tree, we also use a friends-of-friends reconnection scheme to handle reconstructing the network following a disconnect. Lastly, in order to ensure global synchronization of messages, we use a Lamport clock implementation with usernames as our concurrency arbitrator.
